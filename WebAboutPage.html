    <p class="lead container" style="text-align: center">As the world's population expands, finding suitable accommodation is a global problem. <br>
        The global housing gap is estimated at 330 million households, and that is just in urban environments. <br>
        By 2025, this number is expected to grow by 30 per cent, leaving 1.6 billion people without secure, affordable housing. <br>
        In Kenya, affordable housing is part of the Big 4 Agenda and among key points in vision 2030. <br>
        Technology is a very important tool to improve and attain the goals set for this country and that is why we decided to create this Website. <br>
